Introduction to Phenomena: 

The Phenomena club will be the place where various phenomena are created. To this end, we start by learning the fundamentals -- the principle of electronic circuits and electronic components as well as programming to control electronic circuits -- through a wonderful operating platform, the Arduino. As our proficiency increases, we will incorporate more mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering concepts to complete each phenomenon. The projects will be identified, designed, and completed by students in the club. It is anticipated that we will be using the 3D printer to create parts as well as utilizing sensors and actuators in order to create systems that benefit our community. In Phenomena, we learn, we explore, and we enjoy.

Meeting Date:
    
Monday after school.
